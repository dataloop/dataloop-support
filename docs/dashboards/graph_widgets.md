# Graph Widgets

## Chart

A simple widget displaying the area under all metrics.

This is useful for displaying a trend across multiple metric sources. Using the Chart widget will improve dashboard performance if you have hundreds of metric sources. They are also the most readable from a distance if you are creating dashboards for TV screens.

 

## Detailed

This simply draws the data as received. You will get multiple series lines in different shades of the widget colour. There is a legend option available.

These widgets are most useful when troubleshooting problems. Easily spot outliers by clicking the graph widget to get a list of agents and values.

 

## Stacked

Draws all series lines stacked on top of each other and ordered by highest average first. There is a legend option available.

These widgets are useful for visually seeing where the bottleneck is. Plot multiple metrics on a widget and see if there are any humps caused by something specific.
