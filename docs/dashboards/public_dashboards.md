# Public Dashboards

You can generate a public dashboard URL by clicking the share icon at the top of the dashboards page.

Public dashboards provide a read only unauthenticated view that never times out. These are great for quickly sharing a dashboard with a colleague or for use on TV screens.

Upon request we can set a global password on public dashboards so that you can restrict access to your company.

When tiling Dataloop public dashboards with other dashboards on the same screen you may want to turn off the chrome around the edge of the widgets to save space. To do this simply append &chrome=false to the end of the public dashboard url.
