Metric Collection Endpoints
===========================

Besides running plugins, Dataloop supports a number of additional ways to
collect metrics from your system. Generally these are network endpoints that
listen for connections and then forward the metrics on to Dataloop. Some of
these are hosted by Dataloop; others can be hosted inside your own network.
