!!! note
    We have recently rebranded and changed our name from Dataloop.IO to Outlyer. Our agent is still called “dataloop agent”, and relevant code reflects the old name (Dataloop) as well. Thank you for your patience as we update everything.

# InfluxDB

You can send InfluxDB metrics into Outlyer using the following url:

<http://fingerprint@influxdb.dataloop.io:8086>

Where fingerprint is the string found in `/etc/dataloop/agent.finger` on a server.
